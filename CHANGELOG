v1.0.8
    Changed readingBinary data use 256 (0x100) instead of an expected read amount - this tells the reader that an arbitrary long chunk of data is expected in response.  Thanks to @maxxx777 for this
    Made DataGroup fields publicly readable (after review of PR 38 by @danydev)
    Adds SHA384 support for calculating DataGroup Hashes - Thanks to @maxxx777 for PR 37

V1.0.7
    Change to allow direct access to the underlying DataGroups through read only property dataGroupsRead
    Changed public properties on MFCPassportModel to read only (private set)
    Renamed  readDataGroups to dataGroupsAvailable and changed from [String] to [DataGroupId]
    Made getName() and getIDFromName() on DataGroupId public
    Fixed some logging

V1.0.6
    Change so that SOD hashes are always extracted (if SOD is present)  and checked even if no master list set

V1.0.5
    Fixes for Active Authentication and encoding of Le in DO97 - thanks to @smlu for this.
    Minor SwiftUI fixes for the example app
    Better handling of wrong length (hopefully)
    
V1.0.4
    So, turns out some passports can't send 255 bytes of data in one go, so if we get a wrong length error
       then reduce the amount of data we are attempting to read

V1.0.3
    PassportReader now handles DG not found
    Only tries to read DG's that are available
    Now defaults to not even attempting to read DataGroups 3 & 4 (as Extended Access Control required and this 
       isn't implemented (you can force the read if you want by setting skipSecureElements to false on the 
       readPassport call.

V1.0.2
    Sample app now has an icon (passport image from FontAwesome)
    Sample app date fields now includes date format in placeholder text
    Previous fix for handling errors in DG elements didn't quite work if elements came in the wrong order
       Hopefully this will - thanks to maxxx777 for his help with this
    
V1.0.1
    Added OS_ACTIVITY_MODE = disabled to Example project scheme to hide internall CoreNFC Logging
    Fixed bug where specific data groups were requested to be read but COM overrode this and caused everything to be read
    Fixed bug where if DG3 element came last (which we can't read due to security), then the entire passport read failed

V1.0.0
    Considered stable enough to release properly

V0.0.13
    Updated README with new supported features
    Removed tests folder as they have been moved into the Example Project
    Removed old Passport model (NFCPassportModel replaces it)
    Detail view now shows more information on verification status of passport
    Datagroups 11, 12, and 15 now implemented (DG14 has stub but data not parsed yet)
    Datagroup 15 only parses out an ECDSA public key (RSA still to be done)

    Passive Authentication now properly verifies the SOD data is correctly signed by the Document Signing Certificate
    Passive Authentication now checks all read data group hashes
    
    Now supports Active Authentication - ONLY for ECDSA certificates in DG15
    
    PassportReader now show progress when reading
    Will re-try up-to 3 times to read passport fields (to reduce failed reads), and also attempts to re-establish BAC if we get an error whilst reading
    
    Added Tests back in to Example project

V0.0.12
    Removed old version of getSignedDataFromPKCS72

    Changed getSignedDataFromPKCS7 to verifyAndGetSignedDataFromPKCS7
    Updated above method to use CMS (PKCS7) for verifying the contents of the SOD rather than just dumping the contents
    out (which previously was the case).  The PKCS7_Verify function used only supports PKCS7 V1.5 not the new formats (e.g. RSA-OAEP signed messages)
    NOTE -if the contents can't be verified then an exception is now returned rather than just returning the non-verified signed data.
    
    Fixed a bug with display of Tampered data in the sample app
    Fixed a feature where I was only reading out DG1 in the sample app

V0.0.11
    Major (breaking) changes (sorry)
    Restructured a lot of functionalilty - see sample app
    LDS and Unicode Version now correctly parsed
    MRZ element correctly stored
    Certificates extracted and stored
    Updated NFCPassportModel to have properties that return data in more meaningful form
       e.g. documentNumber, name, documentSigningCertificate, countrySigningCertificate (if found)
    Moved PassiveAuthentication into NFCPassportModel and can be done automatically as passport is read
    PassportReader now accepts an optional URL to masterlist (currenrly needs to be either included in app bundle or downloaded onto device)
    If masterlist url is present, PassiveAuthentication is done as part of passport read.
    Added new X509Wrapper class that wraps up an OpenSSL X509 certificate and can extract elements from it.

V0.0.10
    Added missing parameter
    Removed passiveAuthentication from Example app
    Fixed bug where model changes weren't correctly sent to SwiftUI
    Bitcode disabled as doesn't compile properly without it!
    Removed Package.swift
    Merged in ChristianNorbertBraun's patch for Cocoapod support
    Added JPEG2000CodestreamButmap header check when parsing DG2 (thanks to stack1overflow for finding and reporting this)

V0.0.9
    Added check for openssl supporting the cms command
    Updated sample app to work with to iOS 13 Beta 8 and XCode 11 Beta 6

V0.0.8
    Updated with iOS 13 Beta 4 changes
    Merge pull request #8 from haydarKarkin/master
    Fix that getting MRZ type for ID cards
    Removed included OpenSSL C code
    Ported above C code over to Swift and reduced to only what was needed
    Added .gitattributes files to make project as swift
    Added additional troubleshooting information for when Mutual Authentication fails due to invalid MRZKey
    Merge pull request #4 from WooD1k/bugfix/textfield-deprecated-placeholder-init
        TextFields are using deprecated at iOS 13 beta 3 init
    Merge pull request #3 from WooD1k/bugfix/content-view-visibility
        The main screen of the app is not shown at iOS 13 beta 3
        Use TextField's init without a placeholder property as it's deprecated at iOS 13 beta 3
        Use UIWindow(windowScene:) instead of UIWindow(frame:) at SceneDelegate
    Removed storyboard from Info.plist

V0.0.7
    Passport is now NFCPassportModel as the passportMRZ now actually returns just the MRZ data rather than all the elements.  There is now a passportDataElements which returns these properly.
    Changed MRZ element key - to 5B rather than 5F5B  so it now correctly matches the spec!
    Sample app is back in SwiftUI and fairly well updated (I had some time to properly dive in!)
    Passive  Authentication is now done automatically when the passport is read.
    Passive Authentication has been split up into the two seperate stages (each one can be done independently - so you can check of a passport is signed by a valid trusted certificate (from a master list), and then whether that data has been tampered with.
    Moved some code around


V0.0.6
    PassiveAuthentication now throws errors with better details as to why validation failed rather than just returning true/false
    Added script to create a masterList.pem file from either the ICAO PKD repositry masterlists (LDIF) or a country masterlist CMS file
    Added docs for above script
    Added test masterList.pem file which WONT validate anything
    Updated app readme
    Reverted back to plain UIKit because I'm not ready to focus on that yet!
    Refactored PassportReader slightly - fixed some bugs and moved out Passport to its own model
    You'll note its not using CocoaPods because I'm including OpenSSL!  I was going to use the Perfect-COpenSSL SPM Package but not too happy with that licence! Instead using Marcin Krzyżanowski's OpenSSL-Universal Pod - hopefully this will become a Swift Package at some point
    Added Passive Authentication!  Its included as part of the Sample App for reasons.  Ideally this should be its own SPM/Pod but not got round to that yet!
    It uses the Apps code from OpenSSL for the crypto stuff and as such is a bit (very) janky but it works
    You need to manually add your own masterList.pem file which is a single file of all the unique PEMS in the master list - instructions will be coming soon!
    Fixed Error handling - missed off error check when passport lost connection
    Small cleanup of unused code

V0.0.5
    If an error was sent from the passport whilst reading, the Error now includes a readable reason for that error
    Refactored main UI slightly
    Added ability to lookup errors received from the passport - currently just prints to logs not returned yet
    Moved Sample app UI over to SwiftUI

V0.0.4
    Implemented parsing for DG2, DG7 and COM data groups (inc tests)
    Changed PassportReader to take in which data groups you wish to read and will read those
    PassportReader now pulls data from parsed data groups
    Added DataGroup2 Parsing and tests
    Changed TagError - corrected case for NoConnectedTag and added two new errors
    Renamed DataGroup to DataGroupId and DGMap to DataGroupToFileIdMap due to collision with new DataGroup parsing classes
    Changed type of asn1Length to int rather than UInt64
    Added DataGroupParsing - currently only DG1 parsed out
    Added additional tests

V0.0.3
    Renamed log to Log
    Added some initial tests
    Removed bridging header - no longer required now

V0.0.2
    Updated Readme's

V0.0.1
    Fixed url to point to master for SPM
    Refactored for Swift Package Manager
    Refactored code slighty to make it simpler to use
    PassportReader now does all the NFC stuff
        Just need to call passportReader.readPassport(mrzKey:, completed:) to do the scan
    Started preparations for packaging
    Initial version - working
       Supports Basic Access Control and SecureMessaging
       Reads DG1 (MRZ) and DG2 (image) - in both JPEG and JPEG2000 formats
