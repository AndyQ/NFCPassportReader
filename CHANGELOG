v1.1.9
   Retrieves names from DG11 if present otherwise fall back to DG1 - thanks @TerjeLon
   Fixed bug with Chip Authentication - thanks @pauphi and @jennytellne-cygni 
   Fix Active Authentication with ECDSA signature - thanks @pauphi
   Fix for CA when keyId is not nil - thanks @pauphi

   This will be the last < iOS 13 version as will be moving to async/await

v1.1.8
   Retrieves personal  number from DG11 (if its present) otherwise fall back to DG1 (as per ICAO Docs) - thanks @TerjeLon
   Added support for BDC Date/time encoding for DG12 - thanks @jakub-vallo 
   Fixed wrong type in DG12 - thanks @jakub-vallo and @markus-mohemian
   Fixed extract of ICAO Masterlist extract - openssl cms verify and extract signed command output format changed
        thanks @georgepadayatti
   Fixed issue with continuing scan after read session has been invalidated - thanks @markus-mohemian
   
V1.1.7
   Fix for SecureMessaging - buildD097 where we ignored if length was >= 256 - thanks to @pmitche

V1.1.6
   Fixed tag in DG11 - Thanks @Jusstas.
   Fixed deploying to iOS 12 - added weak framework CryptoTokenKit to podspec - thanks @Jeroenbb94
   Fixed crash in getNextTag when not enough data is present (happens with some passports) - thanks @Benny-iPhone
   
V1.1.5
   Fixed potential issue when checking for invalid ECDSA signatures. Now rather than assuming if both BigNums
     have a zero prefix, we actually check the bignums for validity.
   Added ability to skip Chip Authentication and PACE (use the new skipCA and skipPACE parameters on
     readPassport)
   Added some additional logging and changed some existing logging catagories 

v1.1.4
   Fixed use of ephemeral params that managed to get reverted!
   Added a couple of addition error messages to TagReader
   Added MRZ key logging

v1.1.3
    Fix for some ECDSA based message digests which seem to have invalid format (0x00 prefixed on the integers)
       See OpenSSLUtils :: verifySignature for details on the fix
       Thanks to @wellbranding for the report and helping test

v1.1.2
    Implemented PACE
       Currently only GM mapping is supported (IM and CAM not yet), but supports both ECDH and DH encryption
            Many thanks to @filom again for really helping me debug and fix the DH implementation!
    Added ability to select MasterFile and also reselect the eMRTD application record
    Now tries to read the CardAccess file (in master record) - required for PACE
    Fix to use extended length if the size of the protected APDU is more than 255 chars
       Changed wrapDO/unwrapDO to use TKBERTLVRecord to handle the encoding/decoding rather than doing it manually
       Thanks again to @filom for this fix.
    Some fixes to Chip Authentication not freeing up some objects correctly,
        and also fixes where no ChipAuthenticationInfo sections are included, try to guess what oid it would be.)
    binToHexRep can now optionally output hex as array text (defaults to existing behaviour)
    SHA224 hashes should now be supported
    
v1.1.1
    Implemented ChipAuthentication - currently only ECDH DES and AES based keys are tested.  DH DES & AES keys should work though
    Demo app now includes the SecurityInfos information
    
v1.1.0
    This release contains the following minor breaking changes:
        TagError has been renamed to NFCPassportReaderError
    Upgraded to OpenSSL 1.1.1i
        This moved from typed pointers (e.g. UnsafeMutablePointer<X509>) to OpaquePointers (due to OpenSSL changes)
        No longer accessing OpenSSL structures directly - now using OpenSSL methods (as we should)
    Can use most of it under macOS (not the NFC reading bits though part yet as thats not supported)
        Also, currently can't get images out under Mac as not done the NSImage/UIImage conversion
       Should support macOS 10.15+
    Implemented SOD Verification as per RFC 5652 - this is set as the default behaviour but can be switched back
        to OpenSSL CMS Verification if desired. This fixes the issue where the datagroup hashes are hashed using SHA512 but the
        SOD signed digest is hashed with SHA256.
    Added SimpleASN1DumpParser to parse ASN1 data - bit of a cheat as we just parse the OpenSSL ASN1Dump output rather
        then parsing the ASN1 directly (no time yet to write an ASN1 parser)
    Restructured code:
       split DataGroups out into own files
       moved other structs into own file
    Sample app is a little more feature rich - redesign to make it a little more friendly and usable
        Can export raw passport data (as JSON with Base64 encoded binary fields for each datagroup)
            Select which DataGroups are included in the export
            Can also export the Active Authentication challenge and signature for later verification testing
        Can import previously exported passports (through the Files app)
        Passports can be saved on scan or import (default is off). Saved passports are stored in caches folder (not backed up)
           and stored with .complete file protection (encrypted while device locked)
        Can scan MRZ from passport (Currently using the QKMRZScanner component)

v1.0.17
    Active Authentication now supports RSA Keys (thanks to @himtim for testing and sharing data)
    
v1.0.16
    Fix to SampleApp - to actually use the padded fields rather than using them for the checksum calculation only!

v1.0.15
    Reverted previous TagReader change and dropped MaxReadData back  back to 160 (A0) as this causes issues with older passports
        not supporting arbitrary amounts and failing to re-establish connection. Means a slightly longer read time but better 
        reliability (I hope)
    Added ability to customise the MaxDataRead field - Use PassportReader :: overrideNFCDataAmountToRead(). This is useful for development only
    Now supports SHA384 and SHA512 Datagroup Hashes
    Added better error messages (fixes the TagError 11 message) and debug messages
    Locked OpenSSL version to 1.0.2.20 - (OpenSSL 1.0.2u).  There are currently issues upgrading to latest OpenSSL due to underlying
        c-struct changes.
    Sample app now correctly pads fields if not valid length (e.g. if a passport number if < 9 chars then pads with filler char (<)    
    Added ability for Sample App to import a passport dump file IF a passport.json is included in the app bundle (will possibly look at being able to import from Files later)
    Version is displayed in sample app

    
v1.0.14
    Merged pull request from @JokeCoder - to expose phone number, residence address and place of birth from DG11 if present.
    Changed logging to be able to store all passport logs to a temporary array for sharing
    Example app can now capture logs and share them
    Changed TagReader - now uses LE - 256 for most reads, and only read a specific data amount if maxDataToRead (le) is not set to 256.
        This seems to fix an issue when reading the image and it fails on the last read and drops down to a smaller size. (iOS14 change?)
    
v1.0.13
    Extract script (for creating masterlist files) now skips embedded masterlists which fail verification 
    e.g. UnitedNations CSCA in current ICAO list (icaopkd-002-ml-000161.ldif).
    You can now get the whole byte array for a datagroup (including headers) not just the body
    Added dumpPassportData method to NFCPassportModel to save the passport datagroups as a String:base64String dictionary
    Can now set the logLevel on the PassportReader - defaults to info
    Added better comments for the ASN1 functions
    Demo app now has ability to clear textfields
    Demo app now has the ability to export passport data as JSON file (via ShareSheet)
v1.0.12
    Fix for verifyECDSASignature - better handling of sigData so it compiles with Swift 5.3
    ResponseError now displays the SW tag values

v1.0.11
    TagReaader starts off trying to read arbitary data amounts, however this can fail on some passports which
    seem to need an explicit length so in this case, when we get a failure, fall back to reading smaller specific
    amounts - Thanks for @douglasg for reporting and testing and @SaliienkoAleksandr for testing this.

V1.0.10
    Added ability to customise the mesasges displayed in NFCReaderSession View - Thanks to @danydev for PR 41
    
V1.0.9
    Add better error handling on different session invalidation error conditions - Thanks to @danydev - PR 39

v1.0.8
    Changed readingBinary data use 256 (0x100) instead of an expected read amount - this tells the reader that an arbitrary long chunk of data is expected in response.  Thanks to @maxxx777 for this
    Made DataGroup fields publicly readable (after review of PR 38 by @danydev)
    Adds SHA384 support for calculating DataGroup Hashes - Thanks to @maxxx777 for PR 37

V1.0.7
    Change to allow direct access to the underlying DataGroups through read only property dataGroupsRead
    Changed public properties on MFCPassportModel to read only (private set)
    Renamed  readDataGroups to dataGroupsAvailable and changed from [String] to [DataGroupId]
    Made getName() and getIDFromName() on DataGroupId public
    Fixed some logging

V1.0.6
    Change so that SOD hashes are always extracted (if SOD is present)  and checked even if no master list set

V1.0.5
    Fixes for Active Authentication and encoding of Le in DO97 - thanks to @smlu for this.
    Minor SwiftUI fixes for the example app
    Better handling of wrong length (hopefully)
    
V1.0.4
    So, turns out some passports can't send 255 bytes of data in one go, so if we get a wrong length error
       then reduce the amount of data we are attempting to read

V1.0.3
    PassportReader now handles DG not found
    Only tries to read DG's that are available
    Now defaults to not even attempting to read DataGroups 3 & 4 (as Extended Access Control required and this 
       isn't implemented (you can force the read if you want by setting skipSecureElements to false on the 
       readPassport call.

V1.0.2
    Sample app now has an icon (passport image from FontAwesome)
    Sample app date fields now includes date format in placeholder text
    Previous fix for handling errors in DG elements didn't quite work if elements came in the wrong order
       Hopefully this will - thanks to maxxx777 for his help with this
    
V1.0.1
    Added OS_ACTIVITY_MODE = disabled to Example project scheme to hide internall CoreNFC Logging
    Fixed bug where specific data groups were requested to be read but COM overrode this and caused everything to be read
    Fixed bug where if DG3 element came last (which we can't read due to security), then the entire passport read failed

V1.0.0
    Considered stable enough to release properly

V0.0.13
    Updated README with new supported features
    Removed tests folder as they have been moved into the Example Project
    Removed old Passport model (NFCPassportModel replaces it)
    Detail view now shows more information on verification status of passport
    Datagroups 11, 12, and 15 now implemented (DG14 has stub but data not parsed yet)
    Datagroup 15 only parses out an ECDSA public key (RSA still to be done)

    Passive Authentication now properly verifies the SOD data is correctly signed by the Document Signing Certificate
    Passive Authentication now checks all read data group hashes
    
    Now supports Active Authentication - ONLY for ECDSA certificates in DG15
    
    PassportReader now show progress when reading
    Will re-try up-to 3 times to read passport fields (to reduce failed reads), and also attempts to re-establish BAC if we get an error whilst reading
    
    Added Tests back in to Example project

V0.0.12
    Removed old version of getSignedDataFromPKCS72

    Changed getSignedDataFromPKCS7 to verifyAndGetSignedDataFromPKCS7
    Updated above method to use CMS (PKCS7) for verifying the contents of the SOD rather than just dumping the contents
    out (which previously was the case).  The PKCS7_Verify function used only supports PKCS7 V1.5 not the new formats (e.g. RSA-OAEP signed messages)
    NOTE -if the contents can't be verified then an exception is now returned rather than just returning the non-verified signed data.
    
    Fixed a bug with display of Tampered data in the sample app
    Fixed a feature where I was only reading out DG1 in the sample app

V0.0.11
    Major (breaking) changes (sorry)
    Restructured a lot of functionalilty - see sample app
    LDS and Unicode Version now correctly parsed
    MRZ element correctly stored
    Certificates extracted and stored
    Updated NFCPassportModel to have properties that return data in more meaningful form
       e.g. documentNumber, name, documentSigningCertificate, countrySigningCertificate (if found)
    Moved PassiveAuthentication into NFCPassportModel and can be done automatically as passport is read
    PassportReader now accepts an optional URL to masterlist (currenrly needs to be either included in app bundle or downloaded onto device)
    If masterlist url is present, PassiveAuthentication is done as part of passport read.
    Added new X509Wrapper class that wraps up an OpenSSL X509 certificate and can extract elements from it.

V0.0.10
    Added missing parameter
    Removed passiveAuthentication from Example app
    Fixed bug where model changes weren't correctly sent to SwiftUI
    Bitcode disabled as doesn't compile properly without it!
    Removed Package.swift
    Merged in ChristianNorbertBraun's patch for Cocoapod support
    Added JPEG2000CodestreamButmap header check when parsing DG2 (thanks to stack1overflow for finding and reporting this)

V0.0.9
    Added check for openssl supporting the cms command
    Updated sample app to work with to iOS 13 Beta 8 and XCode 11 Beta 6

V0.0.8
    Updated with iOS 13 Beta 4 changes
    Merge pull request #8 from haydarKarkin/master
    Fix that getting MRZ type for ID cards
    Removed included OpenSSL C code
    Ported above C code over to Swift and reduced to only what was needed
    Added .gitattributes files to make project as swift
    Added additional troubleshooting information for when Mutual Authentication fails due to invalid MRZKey
    Merge pull request #4 from WooD1k/bugfix/textfield-deprecated-placeholder-init
        TextFields are using deprecated at iOS 13 beta 3 init
    Merge pull request #3 from WooD1k/bugfix/content-view-visibility
        The main screen of the app is not shown at iOS 13 beta 3
        Use TextField's init without a placeholder property as it's deprecated at iOS 13 beta 3
        Use UIWindow(windowScene:) instead of UIWindow(frame:) at SceneDelegate
    Removed storyboard from Info.plist

V0.0.7
    Passport is now NFCPassportModel as the passportMRZ now actually returns just the MRZ data rather than all the elements.  There is now a passportDataElements which returns these properly.
    Changed MRZ element key - to 5B rather than 5F5B  so it now correctly matches the spec!
    Sample app is back in SwiftUI and fairly well updated (I had some time to properly dive in!)
    Passive  Authentication is now done automatically when the passport is read.
    Passive Authentication has been split up into the two seperate stages (each one can be done independently - so you can check of a passport is signed by a valid trusted certificate (from a master list), and then whether that data has been tampered with.
    Moved some code around


V0.0.6
    PassiveAuthentication now throws errors with better details as to why validation failed rather than just returning true/false
    Added script to create a masterList.pem file from either the ICAO PKD repositry masterlists (LDIF) or a country masterlist CMS file
    Added docs for above script
    Added test masterList.pem file which WONT validate anything
    Updated app readme
    Reverted back to plain UIKit because I'm not ready to focus on that yet!
    Refactored PassportReader slightly - fixed some bugs and moved out Passport to its own model
    You'll note its not using CocoaPods because I'm including OpenSSL!  I was going to use the Perfect-COpenSSL SPM Package but not too happy with that licence! Instead using Marcin Krzyżanowski's OpenSSL-Universal Pod - hopefully this will become a Swift Package at some point
    Added Passive Authentication!  Its included as part of the Sample App for reasons.  Ideally this should be its own SPM/Pod but not got round to that yet!
    It uses the Apps code from OpenSSL for the crypto stuff and as such is a bit (very) janky but it works
    You need to manually add your own masterList.pem file which is a single file of all the unique PEMS in the master list - instructions will be coming soon!
    Fixed Error handling - missed off error check when passport lost connection
    Small cleanup of unused code

V0.0.5
    If an error was sent from the passport whilst reading, the Error now includes a readable reason for that error
    Refactored main UI slightly
    Added ability to lookup errors received from the passport - currently just prints to logs not returned yet
    Moved Sample app UI over to SwiftUI

V0.0.4
    Implemented parsing for DG2, DG7 and COM data groups (inc tests)
    Changed PassportReader to take in which data groups you wish to read and will read those
    PassportReader now pulls data from parsed data groups
    Added DataGroup2 Parsing and tests
    Changed TagError - corrected case for NoConnectedTag and added two new errors
    Renamed DataGroup to DataGroupId and DGMap to DataGroupToFileIdMap due to collision with new DataGroup parsing classes
    Changed type of asn1Length to int rather than UInt64
    Added DataGroupParsing - currently only DG1 parsed out
    Added additional tests

V0.0.3
    Renamed log to Log
    Added some initial tests
    Removed bridging header - no longer required now

V0.0.2
    Updated Readme's

V0.0.1
    Fixed url to point to master for SPM
    Refactored for Swift Package Manager
    Refactored code slighty to make it simpler to use
    PassportReader now does all the NFC stuff
        Just need to call passportReader.readPassport(mrzKey:, completed:) to do the scan
    Started preparations for packaging
    Initial version - working
       Supports Basic Access Control and SecureMessaging
       Reads DG1 (MRZ) and DG2 (image) - in both JPEG and JPEG2000 formats
